big-o = give upper bound, which means to find the time complexity upper bound = worst case. <br>
big omega Ω = lower bound.<br>
big theta θ = upper bound and lower bound.<br>


θ(1) = upper & lower bound of time complexity of linear search, best case T(n)=a,<br>
θ(n) = worst case T(n)= an<br>
which means, ≤O(n), ≥Ω(1)<br>

O Ω θ
